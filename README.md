NESASM3
==================
A slight modification of the NESASM3 assembler found here:
http://www.nespowerpak.com/nesasm/

The only real changes are to the Makefile, which now is
setup to be compiled and installed on linux.

to install on linux:
	`make`
	`sudo make install`

right now I've only tested on Arch.
